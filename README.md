# Heart disease problem 

### A problem from Ernst&Young company presented on *HackNU* - an international student hackathon.

The goal was to predict the likelihood (in the range from 0 to 1) of whether the patient has heart disease:

0 means no heart disease. 1 means patient has a heart disease.

There are 14 columns in the data set, where the patient_id column is a unique and random identifier.

* Here are files with *Neural Networks* as well as *Random Forest* approaches in .ipynb and .py format to solve this problem. 

However, this codes need further improvements in order to be more precise and accurate.
